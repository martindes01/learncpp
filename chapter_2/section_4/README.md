## Functional separation

### Key insight

Names used for function parameters or variables declared in a function body are only visible within the function that declares them.
This means local variables within a function can be named without regard for the names of variables in other functions.
This helps keep functions independent.

## Where to define local variables

### Best practice

Define your local variables as close to their first use as reasonable.
