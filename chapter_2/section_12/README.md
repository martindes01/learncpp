## Header guards

### For advanced readers

In large programs, it's possible to have two separate header files (included from different directories) that end up having the same filename (e.g. `directoryA\config.h` and `directoryB\config.h`).
If only the filename is used for the include guard (e.g. `CONFIG_H`), these two files may end up using the same guard name.
If that happens, any file that includes (directly or indirectly) both `config.h` files will not receive the contents of the include file to be included second.
This will probably cause a compilation error.

Because of this possibility for guard name conflicts, many developers recommend using a more complex/unique name in your header guards.
Some good suggestions are a naming convention of `<PROJECT>_<PATH>_<FILE>_H`, `<FILE>_<LARGE RANDOM NUMBER>_H`, or `<FILE>_<CREATION DATE>_H`
