## About

This repository contains my notes and exercises following the comprehensive and free (from payment) C++ tutorial found at [https://www.learncpp.com/](https://www.learncpp.com/).

A brief guide to using Visual Studio Code for C++ development can be found under the C++ section of [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs).
