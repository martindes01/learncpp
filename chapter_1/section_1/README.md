# [1.1 — Statements and the structure of a program](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/statements-and-the-structure-of-a-program/)

## Functions and the main function

### Rule

Every C++ program must have a special function named `main` (all lower case letters).
When the program is run, execution starts with the first statement inside of function `main` and then continues sequentially.
