# [1.3 â€” Introduction to variables](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/introduction-to-variables/)

## Data

### Key insight

Programs are collections of instructions that manipulate data to produce a desired result.

## Defining multiple variables

### Best practice

Although the language allows you to do so, avoid defining multiple variables in a single statement (even if they are the same type).
Instead, define each variable in a separate statement (and then use a single-line comment to document what it is used for).
