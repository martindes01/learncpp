# [1.4 â€” Variable assignment and initialization](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/variable-assignment-and-initialization/)

## Variable assignment

### Warning

One of the most common mistakes that new programmers make is to confuse the assignment operator (`=`) with the equality operator (`==`).
Assignment (`=`) is used to assign a value to a variable.
Equality (`==`) is used to test whether two operands are equal in value.

## Brace initialization

### Best practice

Favor direct brace initialization whenever possible.

## Initialize your variables

### Best practice

Initialize your variables upon creation.

## Quiz

   Assignment gives a variable a value at some point after the variable is created.

1. What form of initialization should you be using (assume your compiler is C++11 compliant)?
