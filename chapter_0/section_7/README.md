# [0.7 — Compiling your first program](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/writing-your-first-program/)

## Projects

### Best practice

Create a new project for each new program you write.

## If you’re using g++ on the command line

In this case, you don’t need to create a project.
Simply paste the following into a text file named HelloWorld.cpp and save your file:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Hello, world!";
	return 0;
}
```
